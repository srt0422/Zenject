##Dependency Injection Framework for Unity3D

This is a modified fork.  I had trouble using Zenject in my external libraries and my unity project.  I got build conflicts.

With this version you can use Zenject in your class libraries and in unity.

Installation:

1) Add the source code from UnityProject to your unity project.
2) Build the source code from NonUnityBuild and reference the DLL's in your class library(ies)

You should be able to include your external libraries in your unity project without conflicts.
